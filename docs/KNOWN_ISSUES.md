# Known Issues / Sharp Edges

List active problems with reproduction steps and workarounds.

## Example
- **Tests fail: permission denied to create database**
  - Symptom: `permission denied to create database`
  - Likely cause: DB user lacks CREATE DATABASE privilege
  - Workaround: grant permission or configure tests to use an existing DB
  - Next step: document exact local DB roles and update RUNBOOK

- **`pyenv: python: command not found` when running `make check`**
  - Symptom: backend-test previously failed because `python` shim wasn’t configured.
  - Fix: Makefile now invokes `backend/.venv/bin/python` when available so manual activation isn’t needed.
  - Remaining requirement: ensure `backend/.venv` exists (e.g., `python -m venv backend/.venv` + install deps).

- **Resolved: pyenv `python` not found**
  - Status: Makefile runs backend tests via `backend/.venv/bin/python`, so `make check` works without activation.
  - Requirement: keep `backend/.venv` in place (see `docs/RUNBOOK.md` for setup steps).

- **`make check` backend tests**
  - Status: runs `backend/.venv/bin/python manage.py test`, so no manual activation is needed.
  - Remaining requirement: ensure `backend/.venv` exists (see `docs/RUNBOOK.md` for how to prepare it).
